    <p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</p>

    <p>Sustainable Development Goal 13 is to limit and adapt to climate change. It is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The official mission statement of this goal is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts".</P>

    <li><b><font color="teal">WHY WE HAVE TO ACT NOW?</b></li></font>
    <p>The climate crisis continues unabated as the global community shies away from the full commitment required for its reversal. 2010 – 2019 was the warmest decade ever recorded, bringing with it massive wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, floods and other climate disasters across continents.</p><br>
    <p>Climate change is disrupting national economies and affecting lives and livelihoods, especially for the most vulnerable.</p><br>
    <p>Between 2010 and 2020, highly vulnerable regions, home to approximately 3.3–3.6 billion people, experienced 15 x higher human mortality rates from floods, droughts and storms compared to regions with very low vulnerability.</p>
    <li><b><font color="teal">THE TARGETS</b></li></font>
    <p><b><font color="red">13.1 STRENGTHEN RESILIENCE AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY TO CLIMATE RELATED DISASTERS</b></font>
    <p>- Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.</p>
    <p><b><font color="orange">13.2 INTEGRATE CLIMATE CHANGE MEASURES INTO POLICIES AND PLANNING</b></font>
    <p>- Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.</p>
    <p><b><font color="yellow">13.3 BUILD KNOWLEDGE AND CAPACITY TO MEET CLIMATE CHANGE</b></font>
    <p>- Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.</p>
    <p><b><font color="green">13.4 IMPLEMENT THE UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE</b></font>
    <p>- Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible.</p>
    <p><b><font color="blue">13.5 PROMOTE MECHANISMS TO RAISE CAPACITY FOR PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT</b></font>
    <p>- Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities.</p><br>
